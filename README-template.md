## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was a great revisit of mixing CSS Grid with Flexbox to style the project. The biggest issue I had was tweaking the image to have a purple hue layered on top of it. My takeaway is the UI design aspects such as highlighting a single key word with the purple accent color, shading the image with a color, and compacting the message in short form.


Some code that I'm proud of:
```css
      .parent {
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
        grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr);
        grid-column-gap: 0px;
        grid-row-gap: 0px;
        grid-template-areas:
          "message image"
          "information image";
        color: white;
      }
```
